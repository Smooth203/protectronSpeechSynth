# protectronSpeechSynth
A small concatenative speech synthesis script for a Fallout 'protectron'

The 2 example phrases are: "Do not attempt to flee" and "Hello how are you today? Would you like a drink"

I know it isn't perfect but as far as I know, no one has made anything like this before so at least it's something. All I really need to do is make sure the consonants are being heard properly and maybe add a few variations to prevent repetitive-ness.
